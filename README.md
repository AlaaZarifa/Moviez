# Moviez
## A Simple Movie App Built with SwiftUI (iOS)

Welcome! This project showcases Moviez, a mobile application built with SwiftUI (Xcode 15, SwiftUI 5) that displays various movie listings for iOS devices. 

## Dive into the World of Movies:

Moviez leverages The Movie Database (TMDB) API to retrieve movie data and present it in an organized manner. Browse through different categories like Now Playing, Popular, Top Rated, and Upcoming to discover your next cinematic adventure.

## A Passion Project:

This application marks my first official foray into iOS development, all within the past month! As a seasoned Android developer with a long-standing fascination with iOS, I embarked on this project to broaden my mobile development horizons. Learning Swift has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I'm enthusiastic about continuing my iOS journey.

## More Than Just Code:

Moviez is not just lines of code; it's a testament to my adaptability and unwavering passion for learning. It demonstrates my ability to pick up new technologies quickly and apply them to create a functional mobile application.
